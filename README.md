# FINAL-PROJECT-GLOBAL CANCER PATIENTS 2015-2024
Project on Global Cancer Patients 2015-2024
This project analyzes worldwide cancer data from 2015 to 2024 to identify key trends, patterns, and risk factors.
Studying data from 2015 to 2024 allows us to track long term trends, identify high risk groups, and evaluate how factors such as smoking, obesity, and environmental pollution contribute to the disease. This project, “Global Cancer Patients 2014–2025”, uses Python for data analysis to explore patterns and trends in cancer cases worldwide.
 Here the given dataset was loaded using libraries like pandas and numpy. Then we use matplotlib and seaborn to generate meaningful visualizations.
Then we performed statistical analysis to identify distributions, correlations, and key variables. And also generated summary statistics to understand the overall dataset.
The visualization includes bar charts, line plots, pie charts, heatmaps etc.to show cancer cases by age, gender, region, year etc. and visualized trends in survival rates and treatment costs over time.
This project examined the growth of cancer cases across years, identified high risk groups and regional disparities, analyzed associations between lifestyle factors and cancer prevalence. And also summarized key findings such as rising global cancer cases, demographic impacts, and healthcare challenges. Highlighted how the results can support awareness, prevention strategies, and policy-making.
