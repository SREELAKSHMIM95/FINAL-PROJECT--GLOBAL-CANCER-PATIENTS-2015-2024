# PROJECT ON GLOBAL CANCER PATIENTS 2015–2024
Project on Global Cancer Patients 2015-2024

# INTRODUCTION
Cancer is one of the most critical public health challenges of the 21st century, with its burden growing rapidly worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, new cancer cases could rise from ~20 million in 2022 to over 35 million by 2050. This project analyzes global cancer patient data from 2015–2024 to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about age, gender, regional distribution, risk factors, treatment costs, and survival rates.It applies Python based exploratory data analysis to a dataset of global cancer patients reported between 2015 and 2024. The aim is to clean, analyze, and visualize the data to uncover meaningful patterns, correlations, and trends that can support awareness programs, preventive strategies, and healthcare research.

# OBJECTIVES

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1.Understand the distribution of cancer by age, gender, and region.

2.Identify correlations between risk factors and survival rates.

3.Examine changes in treatment costs and outcomes over time.

4.Highlight patterns that can guide prevention and awareness programs.

# LIBRARIES 
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn

# STEPS

1.Data Loading & Overview: Import dataset using Pandas, Display rows, columns, datatypes, and summary statistics

2.Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, Remove duplicates, Correct data types, Create derived columns, Filter and aggregate data

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Univariate analysis (distributions of age, gender, cancer types), Bivariate analysis (treatment cost vs. survival years, gender vs. cancer type), Multivariate analysis (correlations among risk factors (smoking, obesity, pollution)).

4.Data Visualization: Bar plots, line charts, pie charts, histograms, distplot, scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps, count plot, violoin plot, pair plot, jointplot and subplots for comparison.

5.Insight Generation & Report

# RESULTS AND INSIGHTS

1. Distribution of cancer cases by age & gender

2. Regional disparities in cancer incidence

3. Impact of lifestyle factors (smoking, obesity, pollution)

4. Trends in survival rates and treatment costs (2015–2024)

# CONCLUSION
This analysis provides valuable insights into the global cancer burden and highlights how demographic, lifestyle, and environmental factors influence cancer outcomes. The findings can support awareness programs, policy making, and preventive healthcare strategies.
